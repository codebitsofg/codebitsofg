Here are some projects that are frontend, cloud and backend focused. I like implementing new experiemental features and beautiful designs that look stunning. And these are some of my work I've developed recently. Check my portfolio out for more of them.

A Next.js + Strapi CMS Jamstack blog. Rutin Hero is a static export of a Next.js blog where performance and SEO optimization are of importance. Strapi CMS is used as the Headless CMS choice, and the images are served from an S3 bucket. Dynamic routes are configured by taking advantage the latest features of the Next.js App Router. Page-level SEO optimizations are implemented for higher ranking in search results.

A multi-page web application where brands or individuals can create task based loyalty campaings for their brands or stores. It is still in progress but the user facing parts for now are the introductory pages and a sample product page which are written using Next.js, Tailwindcss and Shadcn. Recharts has been used for the data visualization. I will be implementing Auth.js (NextAuth) for the authentication. The backend will be written using Nest.js.

UnniverseCam is a space faction simulator with planets and starts. The application features a UI managed with React Context API for state management. It brings a complex design to life with elements such as select menus, carousel slides, and footers. A WebGL Typescript class handles logic for the 3D Scene. The codebase is written with modularity in mind. React UI and scene updates each other based on user input. This focus on modularity and synchronization makes the application a great example of how a modular UI can enhance immersive web experiences.
