# ✍ Side Projects

Most of my public work on GitHub is personal side projects that I've created both for testing and challenging my skills and seeing how far I can get with what I gathered from years of experience. Some projects are frontend and some are cloud and backend focus projects. I try to follow best practises, new experiemental features and beautiful designs that look stunning. These are some of my work I've developed recently.

One of my many projects where you can actually create your own resume download and apply for your new job. It is built with Next.js and with Redux as state management tool to save myself to prop drilling. I've tried to follow a very clean design and used styled components to style and give some life to the project.
