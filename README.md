# ü™° About me

I'm a former Web Designer working as a Full Stack Engineer with an endless curiosity in the driver seat. I've started software development with Frontend and could not stop but to explore other areas like Backend development and Cloud. And I've been loving it since and been mostly developing mobile and web apps starting from 2021. I've worked in a digital agency setting on my previous position and right now working as a Full Stack Engineer for a SaaS startup in manufacturing industry.

# üõπ Side Projects

Most of my public work on GitHub is personal side projects that I've created both for testing and feeding my soul with cool looking productions and seeing how far I can get with what I gathered from years of experience. Some projects are frontend and some are cloud and backend focus projects. I like trying to implement new experiemental features and beautiful designs that look stunning. And these are some of my work I've developed recently. Please check my portfolio out for more of them. But here are some;

A Next.js + Strapi CMS Jamstack blog. Skinshore is a static export of a Next.js blog where performance and SEO optimization are of importance. Strapi CMS is used as the Headless CMS choice, and the images are served from an S3 bucket for production use. Dynamic routes are configured taking advantage the latest features of the Next.js App Router. Page-level SEO optimizations are implemented for higher ranking in search results.

</p>

Tasker Manager is an app where you can track your tasks with your team. Collaborate and be productive at what you do. It is written with Nest.js and deployed to Google Cloud. Fully automated with Github Actions. Both backend and frontend are deployed as docker containers and the Cloud SQL instance is provisioned to store user data. Prisma used as the ORM and styling is done with Tailwindcss.


## üì∑ [A HEIC to JPEG Converter](https://heictojpeg.beratgenc.live/)

</p>

The app is a fully functioning HEIC to JPEG converter. It was solely a production of question, can I build my own converter? I've used some other tools for this purpose but creating my own was definitely something. It follows a very clean mono-repo structure with NX. The API is a container deployed as a Google Cloud Run Services. The backend handles the recieved form data from the frontend using multer and processes the image, changes its format as JPEG send sends it back to the client. 

## üêï [A Serverless landing page for an upcoming pet adoptation platform](http://infrastructurestack-nextjssitebucketbd1a5941-isspgruxxmoy.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/)

</p>

I am planning to build the next pet adoption platform in Turkey, with latest technology. This bit is just the starting point to collect emails from users to give them the project updates. The landing frontend is deployed to an S3 bucket and the backend uses Lambda functions and SQS to process user data. The emails are being sent using Sendgrid and the data is being saved to DynamoDB. I am planning this app to be completely on AWS cloud with other cool services they offer.

## üóÇÔ∏è [R Resume](https://resumemaker.beratgenc.live/)

</p>

UnniverseCam is a space faction simulator with planets and starts. The application features a UI managed with React Context API for state management. It brings a complex design to life with elements such as select menus, carousel slides, and footers. A WebGL Typescript class handles logic for the 3D Scene. The codebase is written with modularity in mind. React UI and scene updates each other based on user input. This focus on modularity and synchronization makes the application a great example of how a modular UI can enhance immersive web experiences.
