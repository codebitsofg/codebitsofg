# 👨🏻‍💻 About me

I'm a former Web Designer working as a Full Stack Engineer with a endless curiosity in the driver seat 🚀 I've started software development with Frontend and could not spot but to explore other areas like Backend development and Cloud ☁️  And I've been loving it since and been mostly developing mobile and web apps since 2021. I've worked in a digital agency and right now working as a Full Stack Engineer for a SaaS startup.

# ✍ Side Projects

Most of my public work on GitHub is personal side projects that I've created both for testing and challenging my skills and seeing how far I can get with what I gathered from years of experience. Some projects are frontend and some are cloud and backend focus projects. I like trying to implement new experiemental features and beautiful designs that look stunning. These are some of my work I've developed recently.

The app is a fully functioning HEIC to JPEG converter. It was solely a production of question, can I build my own converter? I've used some other tools for this purpose but creating my own was definitely something. It follows a very clean mono-repo structure with NX. The api is a container deployed a Google Cloud Run Services. The backend handles the recieved form data from the frontend using multer and processes the image, changes its format as JPEG send sends it back to the client.

I am planning to build the next pet adoption platform in Turkey, with latest technology. This bit is just the starting point to collect emails from users to give them the project updates. The landing frontend is deployed to an S3 bucket and the backend uses Lambda functions and SQS to process user data. The emails are being sent using Sendgrid and the data is being saved to DynamoDB. I am planning this app to be completely on AWS cloud with other cool services they offer.

</p>

One of my many projects where you can actually create your own resume download and apply for your new job. It is built with Next.js and with Redux as state management tool. I've tried to follow a very clean design and used styled components to style and give some life to the project.

</p>

Unniversecam is a constantly changing solar system with its factions, stars and planets. The UI is execution of a complex design featuring implementations of common web app elements such as select menus, carousel slides, and footers. The application is a good example of modular UI and how it can be matched with immersive web experiences.
